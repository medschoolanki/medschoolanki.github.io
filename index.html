									<h2>How Can I Use Anki in Medical School? And Why Should I?</h2>
									<p> A <a href="https://goo.gl/cuK2dA" target="_blank">study</a> published a few years ago showed that the more Anki flashcards students did, the higher their board scores were. Students across the country have begun using Anki to supplement other studying methods. The beauty of using Anki in medical school is that in addition to being able to create your own flashcards, there are several pre-made decks that generous students have created and shared. A list of these decks with descriptions and the history behind them is listed below.  </p>
                                    <br />
                                    
                                    <p>A <a href="https://goo.gl/Zks6BN" target="_blank">thorough guide created by a student (Shamim Ahmed)</a> also exists on how to incoporate Anki into your daily study routine in medical school.</p>

							<h2>Most Popular Student Created "Boards-Prep" Anki Decks</h2>
							The following are the most popular student created anki decks used to prepare for Step 1, with a section being updated over the next few weeks for Step 2. Each deck has a brief explanation and a download link. For discussions regarding these decks and other med school Anki decks, go to <a href="https://goo.gl/h1CNwE" target="_blank">/r/medicalschoolanki</a>. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Note: When choosing which decks to use, choose:
                                    <li><b>a Physiology + Pathology Deck </b>, either Zanki or the Bro's deck</li>
                                    <li><b>a Microbiology Deck</b>, either Pepper Micro or Torky Micro and</li>
                                    <li><b>a Pharmacology Deck</b>, either Zanki Pharm or Pepper Pharm</li>
                                    or alternatively, use 
                            <li><b><a href="#lightyear">Lightyear Boards & Beyond Deck</a></b> as it covers <a href="https://goo.gl/Z8nCrD" target="_blank">Boards and Beyond</a>, which a is very comprehensive boards resource</li>
                                       
                            <br />
                            Add in other decks (like Pepper Pathoma or Pepper UWorld) if you use the resources off of which those decks are based. 
                            
                            <br />
                            <br />
                                Ultimately, choosing which decks to use is really a matter of personal preference. 
                            <br />
                            
                            <strong>Most importantly, doing a deck the right way (i.e.- sticking with it and doing reviews every day) is more important than choosing the "right deck", as the decks cover a lot of the same resources</strong>

									<h3>Zanki Physiology + Pathology Anki Deck</h3>
									<p>Created by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/6cx6be/zanki_original/" target="_blank">/u/ZankiStep1</a> and is based primarily on First Aid 2016 and 2017 editions as well as Pathoma and Costanzo. The deck is intended to cover all relevant physiology and pathology for boards. <br />Along with the Brosencephalon deck (<a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/" target="_blank">brosencephalon.com</a>) and Lightyear deck (listed below) this is one of the the gold standard decks for covering most topics for Step 1 using Anki. This version does NOT  cover microbiology (Use Pepper Micro for microbiology.) There have been various attempts at updating Zanki, visit <a href="https://goo.gl/h1CNwE" target="_blank">/r/medicalschoolanki</a> to learn more about them. This is the original version of Zanki Physiology+Pathology </p>
                                    <p>The biggest non-micro topic missing is the Neoplasia Chapter from Pathoma</p>

									<h3>Zanki Pharmacology Anki Deck</h3>
									<p>Also created by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/6cx6be/zanki_original/" target="_blank">/u/ZankiStep1</a> and based primarily off of First Aid 2016/2017 and SketchyPharm. The biggest topic missing is the cancer pharmacology section. </p>
                                    <p>I personally believe Pepper Pharmacology is more complete but prefer the organization/style of Zanki. Using one or the other is a matter of personal preference</p>

									<h3>Lightyear, Boards + Beyond Anki Deck</h3>
									<p>Created by <a href="https://goo.gl/yebtUa" target="_blank">/u/Lightyear2k</a> and based primarily on <a href="https://goo.gl/Z8nCrD" target="_blank">Boards and Beyond</a> videos, with ~22,500 cards and very comprehensive. <a href="https://goo.gl/Z8nCrD" target="_blank">Boards and Beyond</a> is very comprehensive of the material covered on Step 1 and has the related pages in First Aid cited. Watching Boards & Beyond videos, doing the quizzes for the corresponding videos, reading the related pages in First Aid + annotating them, and then doing the corresponding cards in the Lightyear anki deck should prepare students very well and cover the physiology, pathology, microbiology, pharmacology, etc information needed for boards. This new deck seems to be entering the "gold standard" tier that the Zanki Step 1 and <a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/" target="_blank"> Brosencephalon</a> decks are in for covering most topics for Step 1 using Anki. <a href="https://goo.gl/yebtUa" target="_blank"> Read this to learn more about the Lightyear Anki deck </a>

                            <h2>*Notes on Personal Bias</h2>
                            Note: The recommendations made here are the personal opinions of the site creator for the sake of simplicity, as there are nuances and pros+cons to using each deck. Below are some of the personal biases that were held while making the above recommendations.
                            <br />
                            <ul>
												<li> The <a href="#lightyear">Lightyear</a> Boards & Beyond based deck is newer and less tried and trued than the other decks.</li>
                                
                                                <li>The <a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/" target="_blank"> Bro's Deck </a> is older and more "tried and true" time tested than Zanki Physiology+Pathology, so some students argue that Bro's>Zanki. They were both listed in the same box above because the creator of the site considers them to be more or less equal and using one over the other to be a matter of personal preference. For more in depth information about the Bro's deck, visit <a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/" target="_blank"> the site that the creator of the Bro's deck made </a>. </li>
                                
												<li>Due to the newness of all the Pepper decks, it's hard to definitively say how effective it is for microbiology, but the site creator listed it and all the other Pepper decks because of how comprehensive Pepper has been in their experience. The original standard for microbiology was the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B95AVmgWLERlVUJWUm82VlVIblk?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Torky Deck</a> created by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/6zcjt6/thoughts_mostly_selfcriticism_of_torkymicro_step1/" target="_blank">/u/ehtork88</a>. </li>
                                
												<li>For Pharmacology, Zanki Pharm and the updates to it have been around longer than the Pepper Pharm deck, so some students prefer Zanki for that reason. The site creator prefers the Pepper Pharm deck because of the incorporation of First Aid information+images in addition to SketchyPharm in the cards, although this is another case of personal preference between the two decks</li>
                                <br />
                                As mentioned earlier, for really thorough discussions on the pros+cons of individual decks, visit the <a href="https://goo.gl/h1CNwE" target="_blank">/r/medicalschoolanki</a> community. Ultimately, I would recommend trying different decks and/or skimming through them using the "Browse" function in Anki to figure out which decks work best for your own learning style.

                            <p>Below are the boards resources subdivided into tiers. The ranking of these resources is informal and has come from reading internet discussions and talking to upperclassmen about which resources they preferred and thought were the best. <br />
                            <br />
                                In the "Golden" tier are resources that include high yield information and that anecdotally many or all medical students consider to be amongst the best resources to use to prepare for boards.

									<h3>Zanki Step 2 CK/Clerkships Deck</h3>
                                    <p>Created by <a href="https://goo.gl/qe3xW7" target="_blank">the same student, /u/ZankiStep1, </a> who made the original Zanki deck and designed to closely follow along with UWorld for Step 2. General opinion seems to be to do the UWorld questions for the shelf/rotation you’re studying for and then use the corresponding cards throughout the year to prepare for Step 2 CK. Currently the gold standard for Step 2/shelf exam studying using Anki. <a href="https://goo.gl/qe3xW7" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the deck</a></p>

                            Note: The recommendations made here are the personal opinions of the site creator for the sake of simplicity, as there are nuances and pros+cons to using each deck. Below are some of the personal biases that were held while making the above recommendations.
                            <br />
                            <ul>
												<li>The <a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/" target="_blank"> Bro's Deck </a> is older and more "tried and true" time tested than Zanki Physiology+Pathology, so some students argue that Bro's>Zanki. They were both listed in the same box above because the creator of the site considers them to be more or less equal and using one over the other to be a matter of personal preference. For more in depth information about the Bro's deck, visit <a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/" target="_blank"> the site that the creator of the Bro's deck made </a>. </li>
												<li>Due to the newness of all the Pepper decks, it's hard to definitively say how effective it is for microbiology, but the site creator listed it and all the other Pepper decks because of how comprehensive Pepper has been in their experience. The original standard for microbiology was the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B95AVmgWLERlVUJWUm82VlVIblk?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Torky Deck</a> created by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/6zcjt6/thoughts_mostly_selfcriticism_of_torkymicro_step1/" target="_blank">/u/ehtork88</a>. </li>
												<li>For Pharmacology, Zanki Pharm and the updates to it have been around longer than the Pepper Pharm deck, so some students prefer Zanki for that reason. The site creator prefers the Pepper Pharm deck because of the incorporation of First Aid information+images in addition to SketchyPharm in the cards, although this is another case of personal preference between the two decks</li>
                                <br />
                                As mentioned earlier, for really thorough discussions on the pros+cons of individual decks, visit the <a href="https://goo.gl/h1CNwE" target="_blank">/r/medicalschoolanki</a> community. Ultimately, I would recommend trying different decks and/or skimming through them using the "Browse" function in Anki to figure out which decks work best for your own learning style.

(Note: if you want to use this concept with any of the Pepper decks, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NR7PRJvRWw&t=3s" target="_blank"> this video</a> to learn how to use the Pepper decks because the creator UCsultanpepper incorporated tags and the hierarchical tags addon to make studying a specific topic very easy without the need for creating a Filtered Deck).</p>
