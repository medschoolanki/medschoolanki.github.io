									<h2>What is Anki?</h2>
									<p>Anki is a studying aid created by Damien Elmes. It is a flashcard app that uses a novel spaced repetititon algorithm to maximize learning. There are Anki apps available on Windows, Mac, Android, (all free) and on iOS ($25) as well as a browser version @ <a href="https://ankiweb.net/"> AnkiWeb.net</a> that can all be synced to one account</p> 
                                    <p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"> Click here</a> to download the Anki Desktop app (for Windows or Mac, both are free) or download it at the Google Play Store or App Store on your mobile device</p>
                                    To learn how to install Anki and create an AnkiWeb profile, click <a href="#four" class="scrolly">here</a>

									<h2>How Can I Use Anki in Medical School? And Why Should I?</h2>
									<p> A study published a few years ago showed that the more Anki flashcards students did, the higher their board scores were. Students across the country have begun using Anki to supplement other studying methods. The beauty of using Anki in medical school is that there are several pre-made decks that generous students have created and shared. A list of these decks with descriptions and the history behind them is listed below.  </p>

							<p>The following are the most popular student created anki decks used to prepare for Step 1. Each deck has a brief explanation and a download link.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-stethoscope"></span>
									<h3>Zanki Physiology+Pathology Anki Deck</h3>
									<p>Created by /u/ZankiStep1 and is based primarily on First Aid 2016 and 2017 editions as well as Pathoma and Costanzo. The deck is intended to cover all relevant physiology and pathology for boards. <br />Along with the Brosencephalon deck (<a href="https://www.brosencephalon.com/" target="_blank"> brosencephalon.com </a>) this is the gold standard for covering most topics for Step 1 using Anki. Does NOT  cover microbiology (Use Pepper Micro for microbiology.) </p>
                                    <p>The biggest non-micro topic missing is the Neoplasia Chapter from Pathoma</p>

									<span class="icon major fa-medkit"></span>
									<h3>Zanki Pharmacology Anki Deck</h3>
									<p>Also created by /u/ZankiStep1 and based primarily off of First Aid 2016/2017 and SketchyPharm. The biggest topic missing is the cancer pharmacology section. </p>
                                    <p>I personally believe Pepper Pharmacology is more complete but prefer the organization of Zanki.</p>
